> Using a Git branch allows developers to work on a new feature without changing the main code. The following is one way to create and commit to a new branch.

Brief Git branch overview:

1. To create a new branch, click the button below on your github repository then enter name of your branch.

2. Once the branch is made, download the repository to your desktop using `git clone [repository link]`

3. Go inside the cloned folder, then run `git checkout [name of branch]`. This will switch from main branch to your desired branch. 

4. (optional) Run `git status` to see if you have successfully swapped branches.

5. Now, you are ready to make changes to the created branch. After making changes to the files, run the usual commands like the following: 

   ```
   git add [filename1] [filename2] 
   git commit -m [commit message]
   git push
   ```

Now, we have successfully made a branch and committed changes to it. The `git merge` command can be used later if you wish to merge the branch with the main branch.
