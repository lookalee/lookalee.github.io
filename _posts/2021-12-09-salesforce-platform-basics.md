## Salesforce Platform Intro

- Salesforce is more than just a CRM(Customer Relation Management). First, we can see some of the standard functionalities like below:
  - It stores customer data
  - Gives processes to nurture prospective customers
  - Provide collaboration techniques.
  - Etc
- Apart from these standard functionalities, the Salesforce platform allows customization so that the provided tools are unique to the company.

- Both declarative development (developing without code) and programmatic development is supported. 
  - The programmatic development uses things like Lightning components.

- Everything resides in the cloud
- The Salesforce platform is the foundation of services. It is powered by meta data and has various parts such as data services, AI, and API
- All apps sit on top, including pre-built apps like 'sales'.
- Metadata: data about data, such as object fields, and other customizations
- APIs: allow different pieces of software to connect with each other.
