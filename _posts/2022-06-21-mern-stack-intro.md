### [MERN Stack] Introduction

#### What is React?

- Client-Side (Browser) Library that allows you to build reactive user interfaces, by doing the following:
  - Render UI with dynamic data
  - handle user input
  - Communicate with backend

#### What is Node?

- Used to execute Javascript outside the browser (Ex: building a web server), by doing the following:
  - Listen to requests and send responses
  - Execute server-side logic
  - Interact with databases

#### What is Express?

- A Node JS Framework that simplifies server-side code and logic, by using:
  - Routing, view-rendering, etc
  - Middleware-based: Funnel requests through functions.

#### What is Mongo DB?

- NoSQL Database that stores "Documents" in "Collections", instead of "Records" in "Tables" like SQL.
  - Stores app data, such as users or products
  - Does not require data schema or relations
  - Advantage: Easily connected to Node/Express
