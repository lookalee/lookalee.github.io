## Introduction to React

### What is React?
- React.js is a Javascript Library for building highly reactive modern user interfaces, and therefore the frontend of the web
    - React does not run on a server, and does not communicate with databases.
- React uses a **user declarative** approach, meaning that we define the **results**, and not the steps
