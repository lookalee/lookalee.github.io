## Create React App (CRA): Installing, Terminal Commands, Webpack, Modules

### What is Create React App?
- A utility script that creates a skeleton react project. 
    - has 'src' folder for all components
    - has 'public' folder that will have index.html file
    - Sets JS files to run through Babel automatically.
- This should be used instead of CDN links.

### How to install 'Create React App'
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app {app name}
cd {app name}
npm start
```

### Important Commands
- `npm start` : Brings up dev server. If this server is closed, we can't preview the app anymore.
- `npm run build` : Bundles app into static files for production
- `npm test` : Starts test runner
- `npm run eject` : Removes the tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files, and scripts into the app directory. This cannot be undone. 

### Webpack
- CRA is built on top of a webpack. 
- Webpack : JS utility that enables import/export of modules.
    - Packages up all CSS, images, and JS into a single file for the browser.
    - Reduces no. of necessary HTTP requests.
    - Allows hot reloading (automatic reload when source file changes)
    - Allows easy testing and deployment
